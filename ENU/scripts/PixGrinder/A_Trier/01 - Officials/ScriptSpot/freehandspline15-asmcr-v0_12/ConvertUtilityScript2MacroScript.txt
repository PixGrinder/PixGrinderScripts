You're so welcome!

No.

Not to my knowledge. Maybe I'll have to write one...
In the meantime, compare the two scripts in the zip.
Essentially,
- replace the 'utility' command with 'macroScript' and it's associated parameters
- create a 'NewRolloutFloater' at the beginning of the macroScript block.
- use 'addRollout' at the end of the MacroScript block to, well, add the rollouts to the floater.

Give it a try...
